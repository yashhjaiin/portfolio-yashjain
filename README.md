**Step 2:** If you are able to see **version** you can skip this step. If not please execute this command in cmd
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Now execute `Step 1` to verify your install.

git clone https://github.com/yashhjaiin/portfolio-yashjain
```

>After the repository is cloned. Navigate to the newly created repository folder by
```
cd portfolio-yashjain
```

**Step 5:** Now execute this command to download packages needed for this app to run.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 6:** Create a superuser and password
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
You will be prompted to enter
>Username (leave blank to use 'yashj'): yashjain
